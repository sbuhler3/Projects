          variety of choices as there are well over 300 breeds recognized by the
          World Canine Organization. Adopting a dog offers mutual benefits
          between dog and owner. Many studies cite the social benefits of having
          a companion as well as the reduced feelings of loneliness from
          adopting a dog. Studies even show medical indicators such as

          opportunities for exercise. In this page, you will find more

          Throughout dogs&#39;s lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer
          meals as they mature. Puppies should be nursed the first two months,
          then introduced to three meals per day when they are about three to
          six months years old. Their food intake should be reduced to two meals
          per day when they are six months to one year old and finally reduced
          to one meal after they reach one year old. And a dog&#39;s typical
          body mass is composed of somewhere between 60 and 70 percent water.
          The
          <a

          says just a 10 percent decrease in body water can cause illness, and a
          15 percent loss can cause death, so make sure you keep your pooch
          hydrated! Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of
          activity to keep their organs healthy, as well as sun and fresh air.
          The minimum recommended time for exercise varies greatly with breed
          and size differences, but generally a range of 30&#45;120 minutes of
          exercise is recommended per day! Can you imagine exercising two hours
          per day? OK, I know that wouldn't bother some of you reading this. But
          the thought of it to me makes me cringe! And by the way, exercising
          your dog does not mean you are being challenged to a push-up contest.
          Brisk walks are OK too! You can also choose from a variety of toys to
          encourage physical activity; just be sure they are age appropriate and
          do not pose a choking hazard. Pay careful attention to toys that
          require supervision.

          Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So
          be sure to brush frequently to reduce the amount of shedding and
          prevent matted and tangled fur that can prove to be extremely
          difficult to remove. Check for insects such as ticks and fleas,
          especially after visiting heavily wooded areas. Bathing is not only
          important to your dog&#39;s health but can be an exercise depending on
          how strong willed the dog is. Rinse all of the soap out, as any
          residual soap can result in a rash. Be sure the soap is formulated for
          your puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can cause allergic reactions. And
          as always, be careful how you handle your loved one. No matter the
          size of your dog, you need to be cautious as you carry your canine. If
          you have a small dog, then cradle the pup with one hand under the
          chest and the forearm supporting the back half. If it is a large dog,
          reach under the belly with both your arms perpendicular to the dog,
          and use each arm to support the chest and rear as you lift.

          You should always consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core
          set of vaccines that are typically recommended. Vaccines that reduce
          the exposure risk to things such as hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus.
          Others may be determined by your vet depending on the environment in
          which the dog resides. Some of these include
