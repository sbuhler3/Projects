        Pets are nature's gift to humanity. It has been scientifically proven
        that opening our homes and hearts to a pet increases our longevity and
        improves our overall quality of life as well as the lives of our pets.
        At Pet Paradigm Professionals, our mission is to offer resources to help
        you care for your furry, scaly, feathery, and slimy loved ones. Our pet
        experts—or “Pexperts”—have been working with pet owners and
        professionals alike for the past twelve years. They offer one-on-one
        consultations with current and prospective pet owners as well as group
        presentations designed for veterinary, pet shelter, and pet breeding
        professionals.
