          >Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia
          region and are currently the second most popular domestic pet in the
          United States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds,
          care and diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and
          practices are generally recommended for the well-being of your fluffy
          family member regardless of breed.</em

          It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that
          is either pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her young if possible.
          Monitor your kitten&#39;s growth closely to make sure its growth rate
          is progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient
          rate, a caretaker might need to feed the kitten directly either with a
          bottle or a feeding tube. Some reasons why kittens might not gain
          weight appropriately include the following:<br />
          • too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk <br />•
          gastrointestinal disease <br />• environmental conditions such as
          extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary conditions

          Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically
          around three to four weeks after birth. According to the ASPCA,
          kittens at this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or
          six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has
          difficulties eating hard food, a small amount of water can be added to
          soften the food. Cat food that is optimized for kittens provides the
          additional nutrients that are needed for growth, energy, and wellness.
          Depending on the breed, your cat may have different dietary
          requirements. You should always consult with your veterinarian for
          recommendations.

          This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many
          nutrients. At this age, their level of activity decreases, and so does
          their metabolism. It is not recommended to leave food out for the cats
          all day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals
          rather than snacking throughout the day. This practice reduces the
          risk of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.

        Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and
        experience a lot of changes. Cats at this age should eat less fats and
        calories and more quality proteins. This means when you are purchasing
        packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular
        protein (such as "salmon") and not just a category (such as fish). This
        usually means they are byproducts, or combinations, of lesser quality
        proteins.
